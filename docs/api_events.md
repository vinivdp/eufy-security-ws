This event is sent whenever battery fully charged is triggered by the device (the cooldown is determined by the `eventDurationSeconds` param).

```ts
interface {
  type: "event";
  event: {
    source: "device";
    event: "battery fully charged";
    serialNumber: string;
    state: boolean;
  }
}
```

### `lookup failure`

[compatible with schema version: 22+]

This event is sent when a standalone camera (T8B0*, T8150*) fails to connect because local network lookup failed and the HTTP connection timed out. This indicates the device is truly offline (not reachable on local network).

```ts
interface {
  type: "event";
  event: {
    source: "device";
    event: "lookup failure";
    serialNumber: string;
  }
}
```
